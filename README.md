Struck code Copyright (C) 2011 Sam Hare, Oxford Brookes University, Oxford, UK

Code from: http://www.samhare.net/research/struck

This github repository is copy of version v4 of Sam Hare's code, with the following modifications:

* CMake build system (instead of Visual Studio and Makefile),
* the build target is a library instead of an executable,
* addition of a "service" wrapper to interface Struck via ICE to [EasyCV/CVAC](http://npsvisionlab.github.io/CVAC/).
